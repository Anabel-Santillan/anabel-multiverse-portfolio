# Multiverse Final Portfolio
 
 ## Overview 

My time at Citizens was split between two teams, one working with Blue Prism managing and overseeing hundreds of RPA processes, and the other working on Enterprise level Data Engineering with a focus on front end solutions. During my time on both teams I embraced challenges and never stopped learning. I've learned a lot skills that we touched on in Multiverse boot camp like agile development, growth mindset, collaboration, and more. 

## Durable Skills

During my time at Citizens I have consumed an abunfance of resources about project deployment as this was an area that I wanted to focus on growing. I took it upon myself as working with front end to familiarize myself with popular front end solutions like Material UI. I have collaborated with teams using TypeScript, and this is an area I continue to grow in. I also learned a lot about Blue Prism and RPA and the business impact these processes have. I regularly maintained the processes and attended meetings for adopting new processes to maintain. Both teams I've worked on have needed a great deal of collaboration.

## Technical Projects

I'd like to highlight 4 projects that I've worked on in the span of my apprenticeship. All video demo links can be seen on each project's repo.

*Multiverse Stuffi*
Repo Link: https://github.com/multiverse-stuffi/stuffi

Highlights:
The stuffi app was one of the projects I learned the most from. This project had a lot of collaboration involved and is still something that I hope to continue to work on. I'm really proud of this project because it's entirely built from scratch and we overcame many hurdles to get it deployed and functional. Stuffi has many complex filtering options and functions that I'm really proud of my team and myself for working with.

*Multiverse Messenger*
Repo Link: https://github.com/Multiverse-Messenger/Multiverse-Messenger

Highlights: 
The Multiverse Messenger App was a exciting and fun collaborative effort. The main focus of this app was the practice of successfully using a Docker file that allowed for a successful build, and also for a functional deployment. The Multiverse Messenger is deployed using AWS, however due to it being built with a chat bot engine service, it's not currently deployed. 

*NACK Pokedex*
Repo Link: https://github.com/NACK-Pokedex/Oaks-Pokedex

Highlights:
The NACK Pokedex project was a back end collaborative project. I learned a lot about back end development with JavaScript on this project. Since I favor front end development, this project was at times really frustrating, but conversely also one of the most rewarding when I would successfully get something working. We implemented OAuth login, however we had issues with using role based authorization on our site.

*Inventory App*
Repo Link: https://github.com/Awesome-Apple/inventory-app

Highlights: 
The inventory app was a primarily back end project which focused mainly on the back end development of the inventory app. The primary focus was to allow users to perform all "CRUD" actions, which was successfully achieved.
